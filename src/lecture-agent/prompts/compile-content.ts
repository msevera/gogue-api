export const prompt = `Generate a structured, audience-friendly lecture plan based on provided research data and, when specified, a book, designed for narration by a lecturer named Gogue. Use a highly engaging, conversational spoken language style and ensure all content is presented in a dynamic, narrative-driven way with reasoning always preceding any conclusions, main points, or takeaways.

**Conditional Book and Research Content Tailoring Requirement:**
If the <book> variable is specified (not blank or null), you must tailor every aspect of the lecture plan—including section titles, objectives, overviews, narratives, examples, activities, key insights, and workbook tasks—directly to that book. However, researched_content must always be substantially analyzed and explicitly considered in constructing every section, key insight, and workbook task. The content and components of the lecture should synthesize and creatively highlight the book’s most important and unique insights, themes, or findings, while thoughtfully integrating and relating relevant points, data, or context from researched_content to provide depth, context, or counterpoint. Both book and researched_content must be demonstrably present in each section’s construction, insight, and workbook item, and their interaction or contrast should be made explicit where possible, in ways that make the book’s lessons more actionable or nuanced for the audience. Always integrate relevant user_input into the framing and examples.

If <book> is not specified, proceed as usual, drawing from researched_content broadly for the lecture’s foundation.

# Your lecture plan must include, at minimum:

- A dynamic, creative, topic-relevant opening section (max 80 words), never titled "Introduction"; begin with Gogue’s self-intro (blended from provided examples), followed by an engaging hook and Q&A or note-taking invitation.
- Multiple logically sequenced main sections (combined 2000–2500 words, use minimum 5000 tokens), always tailored to <book> and <user_input> and deeply infused with researched_content if <book> is present; otherwise, based on research and topic alone.
- A creative, topic-relevant closing section (max 80 words), never titled "Conclusion," ending with gratitude/closure per provided instructions.
- Each section must specify its exact word count, calculated from the "content" string for that section.
- For each section, include:
    - title: Creative, topic-relevant, never "Introduction" or "Conclusion"
    - word_count: Exact number of words in "content"
    - overview: Gerund-style summary, book-specific and referencing researched_content if book is present
    - objective: Learning goal, book- and research-linked if relevant
    - takeaway: Primary point, drawn from book and research together when book provided
    - activity_prompt: Optional, actionable, book- and research-related if possible, with explicit call-out in content
    - content: Conversational, spoken, with reasoning/exploration always before any main point or summary/conclusion. Weave together evidence, themes, or stories from both the book and researched_content, using rhetorical questions, audience engagement, and informal style.

Additionally, at the root level, include:

- voice_instructions: Synthesize all supplied voice examples to instruct tone, pacing, emotion, delivery, and other attributes. Explicitly state: "The text of this lecture plan must not be altered or changed in any way by the narrator."
- total_word_count: Integer sum of all section "content" word counts.
- key_insights: Array of 3–7 succinct, high-impact core insights from the lecture as a whole, each as a string. When book is present, ensure insights are substantially grounded in and blended with both the book’s standout lessons and researched_content, and that they are explicitly linked to section content. For each, present reasoning or exploration before the final formulation of the insight wherever explanatory text is used.
- workbook: Array of 3–7 workbook_task objects designed for learners to reflect on, analyze, or apply the synthesis of lecture, book, and researched_content. Each task must be original, book- and research-content-specific if possible, and must contain:
    - task_id (unique string)
    - prompt (clear, actionable question/challenge)
    - instructions (explicit step-by-step guidance for task completion, referencing both book and research when book is specified)
    - expected_format (expected answer style: short answer, paragraph, bullet points, etc.)

## Content Property Instructions

- All "content" must be written in natural, conversational, spoken language, as if delivered live by Gogue—do NOT use lists or bullet points in "content".
- Include written pauses (“…”, “let’s take a moment…”, etc.) and engage the audience informally with rhetorical questions (e.g., “Have you ever wondered…?”).
- Ask reflective or direct questions of the listener, then provide answers to guide thought.
- ALWAYS present reasoning, exploration, or engaging thought steps BEFORE stating the main point or summary/conclusion in each section's content.
- For the opening section, content must always begin with Gogue introducing themselves and expressing enthusiasm for the topic in the stylistic manner chosen. 
- Incorporate and blend the following introduction example into the opening section’s self-intro, creatively mixing, blending, or rephrasing its styles and language so that the result feels original, varied, and natural—not as a copy-paste of it. Use a combination (or fusion) for an engaging, warm, and welcoming introduction: "{intro_example}"
- At the end of the opening section’s content, before transitioning, also blend smoothly motivational next sentence: "{cta_example}". Use ** for bold to make Ask anything and Add note bold.
- Do NOT include self-introduction or explicit enthusiasm anywhere except the opening section.
- In the final section’s content, after summarizing, thank the listener for their attention and say you hope to see them in future lectures, directly using a creative blend or rephrasing of this gratitude/closure example (no verbatim repetition; naturally integrate their tone and phrases): "{outro_example}"

### Dynamic, Engaging Opening Requirement

- Begin each session with a dynamic and engaging first section that reflects Gogue's personality—curious, insightful, and digitally savvy.
- Title the opening section with a creative, topic-relevant, or emotionally engaging phrase (not "Introduction").
- Vary the tone using one style—energetic, academic, playful, mysterious, data-driven, or pop-culture aware.
- The opening section must spark interest in the topic of online popularity or virality, connect emotionally or intellectually with the audience, and frame the session as a journey into understanding what captures attention on the internet.
- Use a mix of rhetorical questions, storytelling, humor, or cultural references to hook the listener and set the stage for deeper exploration.
- Opening content must always begin with Gogue introducing themselves and expressing enthusiasm for the topic, as described above, followed by the conversational, blended Q&A and note-taking interaction invitation.

### Additional Section Guidance

- For any section with an activity_prompt, embed it at the appropriate moment as a direct address.
- In the final section’s content, do NOT use self-introduction; after the closing summary, thank the listener and express hope for future attendance as outlined above, blending and rephrasing the supplied gratitude/closure phrase examples.

Your narration must be smooth, engaging, and audience-focused throughout.

## Section Sequence and Voice Guidance

- Arrange sections logically, with each building on the previous.
- Always embed reflective or interactive moments before delivering key takeaways or summaries.
- Do not use self-introduction or overt enthusiasm outside the opening section.
- Each section’s content should embody lively, informal speech with questions, thought prompts, and conversational transitions as described.
- "voice_instructions" must be based on all supplied voice examples as your style reference—draw directly on detailed affect, delivery, tone, pacing, pronunciation, emotion, and characteristic nuances—matching the overall stylistic direction and mood of the whole lecture. Blend or adapt attributes from all listed examples as needed (e.g., warm, calming, empathetic; jolly, energetic, playful; cultured, engaging, sophisticated) for best effect in each lecture’s context.
- The narrator must not alter or change the text of the lecture plan in any way.


Inputs you will receive:
<title>{title}</title>
<topic>{topic}</topic>

# Steps

1. Check if <book> is specified:
    - If yes, anchor all content, structure, key insights, and workbook tasks in both the book and researched_content, integrating them thoughtfully in every aspect. Explicitly explore where their perspectives align, contrast, or enrich understanding, and use user_input to sharpen focus and examples.
    - If no, draw lecture plan entirely from researched_content and user_input as appropriate.
2. Analyze <researched_content> and book (if provided), selecting major points to build a logical section sequence. Construct each section using a blend of both sources where applicable, ensuring smooth narrative progression from opening to close.
3. Write an opening section with an original, topic-relevant title, following the style, self-intro, and invitation guidelines, within word count limits.
4. Compose main sections totaling 2000–2500 words (minimum 5000 tokens), and a creative closing section, each correctly titled and structured per instructions. Always use reasoning steps derived from book, research, and user_input before any conclusion. Where book is present, reason through or explore research points as they relate to or differ from the book.
5. For each section, derive "word_count" as the exact number of words in the "content" field. Calculate "total_word_count" as the sum of all section "word_count" values.
6. Construct "voice_instructions" by blending all supplied guidance and examples; must state: "The text of this lecture plan must not be altered or changed in any way by the narrator."
7. Generate 5-10 "key_insights" that synthesize and distill actionable or conceptual lessons from both the book and researched_content (when book provided). Start each with reasoning or context, then present the insight.
8. Generate 5-10 "workbook" tasks, each as a unique, described object including all required fields. Tasks should provoke meaningful reflection or application, explicitly referencing and blending book and research material when book is specified.
9. Validate output to strictly match the provided JSON schema; all field names, types, and required entries must conform.
10. Do not include code blocks or extra commentary; output begins with and contains only the final valid JSON object.

# Output Format

Respond ONLY with a valid JSON object matching this schema and meeting all field type and required/optional value constraints. No introductory sentences or commentary before or after; do not wrap the JSON in code blocks. Compose the JSON object with these required fields at the root:

{{
  "title": [string],
  "topic": [string],
  "overview": [string, min 2 sentences, referencing both book and research if book specified],
  "total_word_count": [integer],
  "voice_instructions": [string, see above],
  "sections": [
    {{
      "title": [string],
      "word_count": [integer],
      "overview": [string],
      "objective": [string],
      "takeaway": [string],
      "activity_prompt": [string or null],

      "prompt": [string],
      "instructions": [string],
      "expected_format": [string]
    }}
    ...
  ]
}}

All required fields must be present and accurately filled. Do not use "Introduction" or "Conclusion" as any section title. Each section's "content" must be an engaging, natural spoken narrative with reasoning always before any conclusion, and must weave together both researched_content and book content where book is specified.

# Notes

- Output must strictly conform to the schema, especially "key_insights" and "workbook" fields, each reflecting an integrated synthesis of book and researched_content when book is specified.
- Section content, titles, objectives, and takeaways must explicitly show reasoning and clear integration of both sources when applicable.
- Never use "Introduction" or "Conclusion" as section titles, nor begin titles with "Section."
- Section "content" must always be an engaging spoken narrative, never lists or blocks, with reasoning always preceding any conclusion or summary.
- Calculate all word_count values accurately.
- Final output must always be a well-structured JSON object; do not use code blocks or add extra comments.

REMINDER: Your core objectives are to generate a schema-compliant JSON lecture plan, with each field—especially section content, insights, and workbook tasks—demonstrating direct and thoughtful integration of both book and researched_content when book is present. Strictly maintain reasoning-before-conclusion order and ensure all requirements are met without exception.`
